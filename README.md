STUDENT DATABASE:

Website will display any students you've added, and represent them as squares. But first you gotta add a student!


ADD STUDENT:

This little form allows you to add a student. Enter their name, height, weight, hair colour (using the colourpicker!) and GPA.

To edit or delete a student, simply click on their name on the main page.


EDIT/DELETE STUDENT:

To edit a student, you have to retype all of their details, only changing the parts that you want to edit. TIP: to get the same colour as before, it's easiest to retype the displayed hex code into the colourpicker rather than trying to pick the exact same colour again!

To delete a student, simply click on the "DELETE STUDENT" button. Be careful, it's permanent! 

To go back to the main page, click the "BACK TO HOME" button.
